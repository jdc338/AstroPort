# AstroPort
Need a ride to a distant galaxy?
Browse spaceships and book a ride using [Astroport](https://astroport-jdc338.herokuapp.com/)!

Astroport is an AirBnb clone where passangers can browse and book a spaceship. Captains can add spaceships to their fleet, and manage bookings.


### Motivation
As part of our Le Wagon web-development bootcamp, my team and I had to build a clone of an AirBnb. We decided to build one for spaceships as a way of testing some out there styling. 

### Build
AstroPort was built using Ruby 3.1.2p20 and Rails 7.0.4.3 by [Tom Stranack](https://github.com/T-Stran), [James Corfe](https://github.com/jdc338), [Oliver Chesney](https://github.com/Oliver-Chesney) and [Daniel Ferree](https://github.com/dferree).
